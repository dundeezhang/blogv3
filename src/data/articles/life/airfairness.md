# First Internship

August 30, 2025

If there's one thing that the University of Waterloo is known for, it would be it's [co-op program](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/co-op). Most students here are enrolled in the so called "co-op program" which basically means they must do 5 or 6 internships throughout university. 

I am no exception, thus I spent a lot of time during my Winter 2025 study term applying for internships through the school job board WaterlooWorks and externally. The final numbers I had for jobs applied was around 300 total jobs applied and only 4 offers.

In the above sankey, you can see I applied to 219 jobs through WaterlooWorks and 50 (though it's closer to 100 when I recounted) through external job boards. I ended up getting a job through a posting in WaterlooWorks but most of my friends had no luck there.

Thus, when I recieved a good offer from [airfairness](https://airfairness.com), I couldn't say no. It was already past exams and I hadn't recieved an offer I was remotely happy with yet, so this was a no brainer. Honestly, taking this position in hindsight was a gnarly since it was a new start up that just got into [Velocity](https://www.velocityincubator.com/). However, it also meant that airfairness was taking a big gamble on the 5 interns they were going to hire to get themselves launched.

Looking back on my 4-month journey at airfairness, I can confidently say that the bar has been set incredibly high for what I expect from future work experiences. This internship gave me my first real taste of startup life, and it was everything I had hoped for and more.

Working at a startup was unlike anything I have ever experienced in school. The pace was relentless, the energy was infectious, and every day brought new challenges that pushed me outside my comfort zone. From the initial sprint to ship the navigator (our [claims submission engine](https://claim.airfairness.com)) to diving into the complexities of airline and aerospace jurisdictions, I found myself growing not just as a developer, but as a problem solver who could adapt to rapidly changing requirements.

The team dynamic was something special. Working alongside my fellow devs: Brian, Kurtis, Jennifer, Sarisha, and Rebecca, created an environment where we could push each other to do our best work while still having fun. We would often spend day-long calls with Dave, our CTO and mentor when we were patching heavy bugs. Our mentor's leadership style was exactly what I needed as someone interning for the first time: supportive, challenging, and always ready with jokes.

What was unique about airfairness (and maybe start ups in general) was the amount of responsibility we were given as interns. We weren't working on side projects, we were shipping the actual product. That alone makes me proud of be apart of the airfairness family. The trust placed in us by the entire team, including John, Zo, and even Alexey from marketing, made every contribution feel meaningful.
