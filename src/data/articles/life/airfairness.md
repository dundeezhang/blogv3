# Reflecting Upon My First Internship

August 30, 2025

If there's one thing that the University of Waterloo is known for, it would be it's [co-op program](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/co-op). Most students here are enrolled in the so called "co-op program" which basically means they must do 5 or 6 internships throughout university. 

I am no exception, thus I spent a lot of time during my Winter 2025 study term applying for internships through the school job board WaterlooWorks and externally. The final numbers I had for jobs applied was around 300 total jobs applied and only 4 offers.

In the above sankey, you can see I applied to 219 jobs through WaterlooWorks and 50 (though it's closer to 100 when I recounted) through external job boards. I ended up getting a job through a posting in WaterlooWorks but most of my friends had no luck there.

Thus, when I recieved a good offer from [airfairness](https://airfairness.com), I couldn't say no. It was already past exams and I hadn't recieved an offer I was remotely happy with yet, so this was a no brainer. Honestly, taking this position in hindsight was a gnarly since it was a new start up that just got into [Velocity](https://www.velocityincubator.com/). However, it also meant that airfairness was taking a big gamble on the 5 interns they were going to hire to get themselves launched.

## Living Alone

Not only was this term my first internship, but it was also my first time living alone. I've always thought of myself as fairly independent, but it was humbling to realize how much work it actually takes to take care of both an apartment and yourself. I rented a place in Waterloo since airfairness has space within the Velocity communal office, but in the end, that detail turned out to be irrelevant.

The first major challenge I faced was not having access to a car. Growing up in the Toronto suburbs, driving was the norm. After getting my G2 (learner's license), I could drive almost anywhere and cut down commute times drastically. Grocery runs, commuting, and general travel were quick and convenient. Without that luxury, I relied on walking and the iON (GRT's Light Rail Transit System). While convenient, it still meant long walks to and from bus stops and rail stations. Grocery trips, in particular, highlighted how dependent I had been on private transportation and made me reflect on how flawed Ontario's city design can be. At least walking 15k+ steps a day and carrying groceries over 2 km helped me get healthier.

This ties into the second major focus of my term: health. During my first year at university, I gained a lot of weight. I started in September 2024 at 69 kg and quickly ballooned to 76 kg by the end of my second term. What was especially horrifying was realizing that I hadn't just gained fat, I had also lost muscle. So, throughout these four months, I made my health and physical activity a priority. I got back into the gym, training at least 4 days a week with 1â€“2 cardio sessions on top. Progress was slow but steady: by the end of the term, I had lost 4.5 kg, landing at 71.5 kg, while regaining most of my strength and stamina. I can now lift my old weights again and comfortably run a solid 5k.

To support this, I also had to watch my diet more closely. Since I had never lived alone before, I hadn't realized just how much time and effort goes into preparing proper meals. It gave me a newfound appreciation for all the food others have prepared for me in the past. Before, food was just tasty fuel; now, it feels like "special tasty art." Honestly, nutrition deserves to be a school subject of its own. Balancing vitamins, protein, fiber, sugars, and fats while keeping my daily calories in check (since I was cutting) was a challenge. In the end, I settled on a simple, repeatable diet: steel-cut oats, spinach, broccoli, and lean pork chops became my staples. Not glamorous, but they worked.

Finally, I want to thank my friend Jason for being there. Whether it was encouraging me to stay disciplined with my workouts, reminding me to take care of myself, or just being there to talk things through, he made Waterloo tolerable. Having someone I could count on through the ups and downs made living alone not so lonely.

## Airfairness

Looking back on my 4-month journey at airfairness, I can confidently say that the bar has been set incredibly high for what I expect from future work experiences. This internship gave me my first real taste of startup life, and it was everything I had hoped for and more.

Working at a startup was unlike anything I have ever experienced in school. The pace was relentless, the energy was infectious, and every day brought new challenges that pushed me outside my comfort zone. From the initial sprint to ship the navigator (our [claims submission engine](https://claim.airfairness.com)) to diving into the complexities of airline and aerospace jurisdictions, I found myself growing not just as a developer, but as a problem solver who could adapt to rapidly changing requirements.

The team dynamic was something special. Working alongside my fellow devs: Brian, Kurtis, Jennifer, Sarisha, and Rebecca, created an environment where we could push each other to do our best work while still having fun. We would often spend day-long calls with Dave, our CTO and mentor when we were patching heavy bugs. Our mentor's leadership style was exactly what I needed as someone interning for the first time: supportive, challenging, and always ready with jokes.

What was unique about airfairness (and maybe start ups in general) was the amount of responsibility we were given as interns. We weren't working on side projects, we were shipping the actual product. That alone makes me proud of be apart of the airfairness family. The trust placed in us by the entire team, including John, Zo, and even Alexey from marketing, made every contribution feel meaningful.
