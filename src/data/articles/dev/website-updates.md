# Website Updates

January 9, 2025

Although I recently just redid my portfolio page last summer, there were still some elements that were substandard. Thus, I changed up some things and redesigned my blog page once again.

Since this is the nth time I've redone this site, I thought it would be cool to look back on previous versions of this site.

## dundeezhangv1

Starting off with [dundeezhangv1](https://dundeezhang.github.io/dundeezhangv1/).

First and foremost, compared to dundeezhangv4 (the most current version of my site as of writing), there isn't much different. The navigation links are still in the top left, my name is big and centre, and the social-cons are horizontal beneath my name. Seems to me that nothing has changed over the last 4 years.

However, this site was written in pure html and css, making it difficult to continuously add content too, which was a big driver in why I updated and redesigned everything multiple times. Also it is worth mentioning that the site was never completed as my blog page doesn't exist.

## dundeezhangv2

Next, we have [dundeezhangv2](https://dundeezhang.github.io/dundeezhangv2/).

The goal with this design was to simplify things and make the site mobile friendly. During this point of time in my life, I was going through a minimalist phase where I wanted to get rid of as much unnecessary things as possible, which led to me deleting most stuff from my site and displaying barebones information. In one of the revisions which I find funny in hindsight was that I changed the text under "Who am I?" to "I am a high school student with no particular hobbies." Now that sounds like something a serial killer would say.

This website revision was also the first to have a completed blog site with a significant number of articles (a singular article).

The blog page.

This page was the first website I ever made to utilize cards which are a common element in my current web designs. As this was 2021, this predates when everyone switched their design language to use heavily rounded corners, so the corners here are still just slightly rounded. Something I think I got right in this design was the drop shadows behind the cards. It gives the site more of a 3D look without adding too much complexity to the visuals.

Don't be fooled by the fact there are 4 cards for articles. There is only 1 article that works, and the only surviving [article](/life/online-highschool) from that time to remain on my blog. There were some issues with this design, notably that each blog card was hardcoded into the site, meaning that I had to copy and paste the same div over and over again to add articles. This quickly got tiring, so I stopped updating the blog, which led me to take down dundeezhangv2 entirely.

## dundeezhangv3/dundeezhangv4

dundeezhangv3 and v4 are essentially the same site, but v3 was written in javascript and v4 in typescript. As of writing, this is the latest version of my portfolio and blog pages respectively. Even though the versions did not change much within these 2 generations, the designs had a few upgrades.

dundeezhangv3 in it's full glory.

I hated this design. That's why it only lasted for 1 week before I rewrote everything. I thought there was no depth on the site, it felt too static, and the font weights made no sense. My goals when designing this was to make a simple static site that was barebones and easy to navigate, but I guess I did that a little bit too well.

Similarily, the blog for dundeezhangv3 was equally as ugly. It can still be found at [blog.dundeezhang.com](https://blog.dundeezhang.com), but I highly recommend not checking it out.

The key word is simplicity. But I think I went a little too simple. The site design is ugly and it doesn't work. Thus I quickly updated everything to dundeezhangv4.

### dundeezhangv4 revision 1

The cards make a return!

As you can clearly see, the design is mostly just a modernized version of v3. There is more polish everywhere including scroll animations and interactive elements. This website was also available in a dark mode since I switched to dark mode for all my devices soon after creating this revision.

I then wrote a [blog](./making-website-1) article detailing my experience making a website for the first time in a few years.

### dundeezhangv4 revision2

As of writing, v4r2 is the most recent version.

Portion of v4r2.

I'm not going to display the full page here since it's too long, but there is more refinements now including cool interactive highlighting, repeatable scroll animations, and I also brought back the navigation list from v1.

On a side note. my goal has always been to create a site that can be as modular as possible so that when I want to update it, it would be easy. As someone who likes to constantly change and customize my things, I was delighted to see that my newly redesigned site from half a year ago was just as easy to patch up as I remember it to be.

I also updated the blog in this version.

In this version of the blog, I completely redid the article system. I switch from typing out the articles in html to markdown to make my life infinitely easier. Thus, all my articles are automatically uploaded when I put my articles in the assets folder without having to worry about styling or formatting. I also did away with the cards, opting instead to have just a title, date and brief description as it makes scrolling through the article links much easier.
