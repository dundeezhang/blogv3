# Deodorants and Antiperspirants

June 27, 2023

> This was an abstract written for my Shad Speaks (Shad 2023 Lakehead STEM Camp). I later gave a more in-depth speech about the science and culture behind deodorants.

As children develop into adolescents, they tend to undergo many bodily changes. One of these changes involves body odour. A common remedy to reduce or eliminate body odour would be deodorant bars. Although many places sell deodorants and antiperspirants, some people still do not use them, which leads to the question of how deodorants and antiperspirants work. 

First, the chemicals and bacteria the human body produces and hosts would have to be investigated for their reactive properties that produce the smell. This would provide the foundation for further insight into how the reactions can be prevented. If the reactions can be prevented by not sweating or a neutralization agent, what compounds can accomplish that?

Subsequently, if the compounds could in theory neutralize the reactions or prevent catalysts, it would raise the question: Would they be safe for human consumption? Often under-researched chemicals are added to products and would later turn out to be a health hazard.

On a different note, some people have less strong body odours than others. It is known that East Asians, in general, have a smaller population of people who need remedies for their body odour. This is due to the apocrine gland appearing in smaller quantities in people around the region. The gland is found in the ear, under the armpits, and around the genitalia region. The gland is mainly responsible for producing body odour.

Therefore, taking into account all the factors above, we can learn more about the world of deodorants and antiperspirants.
