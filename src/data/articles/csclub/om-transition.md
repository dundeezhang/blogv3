# Office Manager Transition Notes

March 24, 2025

> Last Updated by Office Manager W25 for S25

Before reading this, get familiar with the regular Office Training Doc.

Before proceeding with reading this document, it is important to acknowledge that the President selected you as the Office Manager. Thus, now you can go tell the President to go away and to let you handle ALL office issues. 

Do not let the President overstep into your role responsibilities. Speak to the other officials if this is a big issue, they can advise and/or help.

## Budget

Normally, you are appointed Office Manager at the start of the term. Subsequently, you are able to make an office budget to send to the Treasurer. Make sure to include tax and shipping in your budget list as well.

This is an example office budget:

Things you typically want to consider including in your termly budget are:

- EXPO Dry Erase Markers
- Napkins
- Cleaning supplies (Lysol wipes)
- Utensils and Plates
- Printing Paper
- Tape
- Facemasks
- Labels for the label-maker.

You may also consider getting items such as:

- Books for the library
- Thunderbolt docks/displays (if current ones are broken)
- Cables and dongles
- New chairs or couches
- Organizing containers.

After you create your budget, add around a 15% float so that if the prices change, or if you made an accidental error, you are still going to be within budget.

If there are expensive items that you plan to get, you can also consider getting the budget through the Capital Improvement Fund (MathSoc). Note that these must be long-term items such as chairs, displays, etc.

Periodically, you should check if the Naloxone in the room has expired. If it has, visit the pharmacy and ask for a replacement. It is free of charge.

## Office Staff

As the Office Manager, you typically have full jurisdiction over who becomes Office Staff. So the following question follows: "Who should I make Office Staff?" Generally, you want office frequenters who seem trustworthy as your Office Staff candidates. It is also a current practice to leave most staff from the previous term as Office Staff if there are no conflicts of interest. However, all returning office staff must be retrained at the start of term.

This is the list of things you need to train office staff on:

- Office Rules
- Membership Sign Ups (CEO and Binder)
- Fridge Rules
- The Money Cups and Money Rules (3 money cups)
- Swag Purchases
- Librarian
- If anything weird happens, they report to you.

There is a training document in the discord channel as well (pinned messages). You should send this document to the address at [office@csclub.uwaterloo.ca](mailto:office@csclub.uwaterloo.ca) to refresh all staff of the rules after retraining. You should also pin the document in the office staff channel on discord.

## Pop

Pop is easy to do. We sell the pop for the price we buy it at. Typically we want to keep the "menu" the same. We can also sell small snack bags like chips. From W25, we introduced Celsius into the drink lineup and it sold extremely well. Same thing with Starbucks Frapps. I'd recommend purchasing 4 boxes of Celsius (18 cans per box) at a time as it sells very quickly.

Before adding another drink to the fridge, make sure that it does not go against our non-compete with Math Coffee and Donut (Math CnD). Just talk to Rose, or the Business Manager to confirm that the new item is able to be sold in CSC.

You typically want a Costco membership, or a CSC member with a Costco membership. You will likely do most pop purchases at Costco and Wholesale Club. Wholesale Club pop is typically cheaper from my experience and Costco has cheaper snacks. If it is difficult to go to multiple stores, just either one is fine.

This is an example of pop budgeting done to get the price of pop. We want to get as close to 0 loss/profit as possible. Thus, we need to make as close to 0 profit and loss in the end. However the prices of pop will eventually go up, and we can take some "operating loss" to maintain 50Â¢ pop.

This is an example of a pop budget sheet:

## End of Term (Important)

When the term ultimately comes to an end, you have a few responsibilities.

The first of which is to ensure that all office keys are to be returned to the Dean's office, or to you (in which you return it to the Dean's office for them). This is straightforward.

The second responsibility is to move a copy of the swag form into the new executive folder, and set up the new shlink for it. You should delete the old shlink for swag by running `shlink short-url:delete swag`, and then make a new `short-url` with `shlink short-url:create -c swag <FORM-URL>`. Then the site https://csclub.ca/swag should then redirect to your new form. These commands in the instructions may not entirely be correct as I am writing this from memory.

## Office Discipline

If an Office Staff causes issues within the office such as repeatedly leaving office with no staff, or stealing; discipline is necessary. 

If a clean office staff commits a minor infraction, then a quick discussion and maybe a retraining is sufficient. 

However, if the infraction is major, such as theft or stalking, the issue needs to be escalated to the elected executives. The office staff will need to be removed from their position and you need to follow up with why they were removed.

Generally, things should be at your discretion, but it is **very important to maintain constant communication with the President when disciplining any staff members**.

Some examples of minor infractions would be:
- Accidentally leaving office for a moment.
- Forgetting to do the swag form after a swag purchase.
- Locking themself out of the office (leaving keys in the office).

Some examples of major infractions would be:
- Stalking CSC members.
- Multiple instances of leaving the office open with no office staff.
- Breakage of any office rules.
- Theft

However, circumstances may differ and it is your discretion on how to discipline. Keep in mind that this is **not** a democracy. **You have every right to remove any staff for any reason.**

## Other

There usually is one office deep clean per term, and you need to set it up preferably between midterms and finals. During this clean, you should throw out clutter and aim to streamline the office as much as you can. It is also good practice to physically clean the office with wet wipes to get rid of grime that accumulates throughout the term.

If you are unsure about anything, seek advice from other executives, previous executives, and advisors. It is likely they have valuable input on the issue you are having trouble with. The committees discord is organized so that previous executives have access to `#office-staff`, so feel free send your questions away there.
