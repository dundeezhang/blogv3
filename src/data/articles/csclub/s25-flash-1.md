# S25 CSC FLASH 1

May 11, 2025


## CT Dalek would be proud

**Elections**: The Computer Science Club is back up and running for the Spring term! As always, we’ve fired our old executives and replaced them with new actors. Our elections were held on Tuesday, May 13th. Though you’ll likely be seeing this after the event. There were snacks and a Minecraft LAN party. If you missed it, don’t sweat it too much, but just know you’re probably on a hitlist somewhere in the world.

**Service Update**: Our general-use server sorbitol will be decommissioned early this term. We sincerely thank the Math Endowment Fund again for funding this SuperMicro server that we’ve all come to rely on. Goodbye, soldier! You will be missed. ;-;

**Events**: We’ve got a plethora of events lined up this term to spark joy in Waterloo once again. One of the cooler things we’ve planned is a Bonfire event later in the term, meaning that if you show up, you might just witness the rare phenomenon of computer science majors touching grass. Just to be safe, bring nose plugs. Naturally, there will be food and other goodies at the bonfire, so keep an eye out for it.

**Service Update**: As you may or may not know, there was, or still is a service outage affecting CSC Cloud. We apologize for the inconvenience and are working hard to resolve the issue ASAP. Our Systems Committee is dedicated to ensuring a smooth experience for all our members, so rest assured, you’re in good hands.

**Club Merch**: We have CSC merch for sale! You can represent our very own Codey or the beloved Mr. Goose on your own apparel. Prices start at just under $2, but if you want to be an ultra supporter (or if you’re Jeff Bezos), you can pay up to $35 for some high-quality fabric! Buy our merch. You know you want to. Come by our office, MC 3036, to check out the catalogue. 

**Club Pop**: The Computer Science Club is excited to announce that we’ll continue selling Celsius (the lifeline of computer science students) for $2 in the club room at MC 3036. Come by to check out our other pop and goodies, starting at just 50 cents each!

**Election Nomination Funnies**: Two of our beloved club members decided to run for elected positions this term! However, the email they sent to the elections officer was... interesting… so much so that even CT Dalek found himself questioning the future of the club. Here are the emails given here in full for you to enjoy:

As we might say, we are Chronically Socially Challenged (CSC).

Finally, swing by our club office at MC 3036/3037 and say hi! Odds are, the CSC will be open when you drop in. If you’re unsure, just check our club Discord (linked in the footer of csclub.ca) to see if the office is open. (Note that the office status checker on discord only works when Codey (and CSC Cloud) is online.)
