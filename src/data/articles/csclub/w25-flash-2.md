# W25 CSC FLASH 2

February 7, 2025

## CSC Flash 1!

Unfortunately, MathNEWs forgot to publish our very exciting and wonderfully written first issue of our newsflash, so here are some extra long segments for you to enjoy!

The Computer Science Club (CSC) is back in action! Find our club room at MC 3036/3037 to hang out! We have the cheapest pop on campus (that we know of). 50¢ for a regular can of pop is hard to beat, so pop on in, and have a refreshing drink while meeting many other cool, possibly like-minded people!

The Computer Science Club held its first meeting of 2025 last Monday (or a few Mondays ago by now) to elect new executive officers. Iris, the Chief Returning Officer of this term, hosted the elections to ensure a smooth transition of power between executive teams. Due to unfortunate date lineups, the hugely popular Sex Toy Bingo–hosted by WUSA, was due that night as well. Subsequently, insufficient people showed up to the election night, leading to club members fishing out random people from the DC library to participate in the election (with their club membership paid full by the CRO). Thus, the election was able to finally start, albeit roughly 30 minutes behind schedule. After long and careful consideration from the club members, congratulations to Sourojeet, Enming, Alex, and Samir for being legally (no rules were broken) elected to be Prez, VP, AVP, and Trez respectively! 

Recently, we collaborated with MathSoc and DSC to host resume reviews! The event was hugely successful with people constantly waiting outside MC Comfy to get their resume reviewed. Thank you to everyone who helped out including the resume critics, reviewees, and organizers.

If you want a talk on a specific topic, and know a professor, or grad student that would be willing to present a talk on it. Whether it be about trains, AI, or even the technology behind ICBMs, send an email to [exec@csclub.uwaterloo.ca](mailto:exec@csclub.uwaterloo.ca) with their name, and topic! We’ll reach out to them and ask whether they want to give a talk, we’ll sort out the logistics as long as they bring the topic!

The beloved Projects Program makes a return! Right now we’re planning out how to run the Projects Program this term, but stay tuned, we’ll be hopefully announcing it by Mid-March. For anyone who doesn’t know, the Projects Program is an event where you can join as either an individual, or a team. Then you, and your team will work on a cs-related project of your own choosing throughout the term. Every so often, we’ll run an event related to it, where we check in, and talk about our progress. Then at the end, we’ll judge the projects, and award prizes to the winners!

Finally, we have plans to bring back the hugely successful ALT-TAB. The date is still TBD, but expect it to run around the time EoT (End of Term event) would typically run. If you don’t already know, ALT-TAB is for you (yes you, the reader or anyone in general) to give a talk about any passion they are involved with. It is for you to share your ideas with your peers in a talk-like format! Be sure to look out for this upcoming event.

Our Beginning of Term event (BoT) happened on January Wednesday the 29th. We had a massive turnout with no food remaining after the event. Thank you to the events committee for organizing this hugely successful event. Much was done at the meeting, including holding a ratification vote for our sus-admin, who sadly did not obtain enough votes at election night to be re-elected. That is no-longer the case… we now have a newly re-elected sys-admin. The previous terms amendment to our constitution relating to CSC’s syscom and termcom management has also been ratified by members almost unanimously at BoT. So finally the CSC clubroom whiteboard can be used again without a giant, ugly, horrendous, unhandsome and bothersome block taking up most of the space. On a side note, y’all organizers need to get better at the snake game. No shot you guys are getting sub-20 on the snake game when you guys are the organizers. But thank you to everyone who showed up at BoT, and make sure you keep showing up so that your food investment gets returned.

Recently we got the good news that we can hold our first industry talk for this term! The excellent at Blackberry responded to our excellent External Affairs team to host a wonderful industry talk later this term. We are very pleased to be blessed (in the future) with their gracious presence. The talks will be on the week of the 25th, the specific dates/times are to be determined. 

Stay tuned for our next big event – trivia! It is going to be our flagship event this term with much fun anticipated. Not only will it be fun, it’ll be partially academic, so you can brush up on your trivia knowledge while eating free food and winning cool prizes! The date is still TBD, so stay tuned on our club instagram for the date when it gets announced.

For anyone who liked CSC Circles in the past, it returned. The first meeting was held on February 7 this year! We had a solid turn out with many snacks like cheetos, doritos, and cookies. The Reps team had solid energy throughout the night hosting Jeopardy with the teams ferociously fighting for first place. Congrats to team worms for winning the trivia!

## CSC Flash - Fun!

We’ve received funding to spend a little less than 40k on a server from SLEF (Student Life Endowment Fund, WUSA). 40k also happens to be enough to buy a car!!!! We’ll buy the server at some point… We’re currently considering buying a CSC (CS Corvette) to add to our arsenal of “why does CSC own this thing?”

Recently, on a cold morning, the NEAC (Non-Existent Activity Committee, EngSoc) came into existence and decided to vandalise the CSC door. They very rudely taped an ugly purple poster onto our beautiful club room door located at MC 3036 and left a cold-blooded letter detailing their disgusting activities. Even after a week, we are still in shock that such a tragedy occurred and we are looking for active ways to retaliate. Perhaps we shall get a M5 sooner than expected ;). 

We are restocking and updating the CSC library, the most comprehensive MathSoc library. We need recommendations for new textbooks or books on C++, Rust, and RISC-V. If you haven’t checked a book out from us yet, perhaps this article is your calling to visit the office and see our enormous and diverse set of books. Come and indulge in your love for books.
