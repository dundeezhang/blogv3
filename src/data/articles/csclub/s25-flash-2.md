# S25 CSC FLASH 2!

May 26, 2025

**Beginning of Term**: By the time you’re reading this, Beginning of Term will have already come and gone (hopefully along with all the free food). At the time of writing, it’s scheduled for May 29, packed with fun activities and tasty treats. But since time travel isn’t a CSC service yet, what we do want you to do is share your photos from the event and tag @uwcsclub on Instagram! We’ll make sure to send some love your way.

**Service Update**: CSC Cloud is finally back online! That means Codeybot, all your favourite CSC services (yes, even the PMC website) are up and running again. We sincerely apologize for the downtime and are working to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Huge shoutout to our Systems Committee for reviving the servers at record speed, powered almost entirely by Monsters and CnD samosas.

**Trivia Night**: CSC Trivia Night is making its grand return! We're currently aiming for June 18, but that date might shuffle around a bit since it’s still a ways off. Expect a night full of fun questions, great food, and plenty of prizes. So make sure to show up and devour the snacks like the goblin gremlin genius you are.

**Prof Talks**: We’re bringing back Prof Talks this term to supercharge your CS knowledge (and maybe your GPA by osmosis). Yes, there will be food and drinks, but the real stars of the show are our professors. So far, we’ve got two brain-boosting sessions lined up in June with Professors Freda Shi and Tavernes Barnes. Keep an eye on our Instagram for your chance to upgrade your grey matter.

**Office**: Drop by our club office at MC 3036/3037 and say hi! There's a good chance the CSC will be open when you swing by. If you're not sure, just check our club Discord (linked in the footer of csclub.ca) to see if the office is open. CLOUD IS FINALLY BACK SO THE STATUS WORKS!

**Merch**: As always, we’ve got CSC merch for sale. But this time, there’s a twist: you can now browse our full collection online! Head over to csclub.ca/merch to check out everything we have in stock. From E7 tote bags to Codey lambda calculus T-shirts, we’ve got your wardrobe covered in style (and just the right amount of CS major drip). Whether you stop by MC 3036 or shop online, be sure to check it out. You and I both know you want to.

**Pop**: The Computer Science Club is keeping your caffeine levels in check. We’re still selling Celsius, the official fuel of CS students, for just $2 in MC 3036. We’ve also got other pop and snacks starting at just 50 cents (Fuze/Nestea, Fanta, Coke etc). Come by, hydrate (responsibly), like a true code warrior.
