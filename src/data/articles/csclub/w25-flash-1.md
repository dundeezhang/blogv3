# W25 CSC FLASH 1

January 27, 2025

## CSC Flash - Events!

The Computer Science Club (CSC) is back in action! Find our club room at MC 3036/3037 to hang out! We have the cheapest pop on campus (that we know of). 50¢ for a regular can of pop is hard to beat, so pop on in, and have a refreshing drink while meeting many other cool, possibly like-minded people!

The Computer Science Club held its first meeting of 2025 last Monday (or a few Mondays ago by now) to elect new executive officers. Iris, the Chief Returning Officer of this term, hosted the elections to ensure a smooth transition of power between executive teams. Due to unfortunate date lineups, the hugely popular Sex Toy Bingo–hosted by WUSA, was due that night as well. Subsequently, insufficient people showed up to the election night, leading to club members fishing out random people from the DC library to participate in the election (with their club membership paid full by the CRO). Thus, the election was able to finally start, albeit roughly 30 minutes behind schedule. After long and careful consideration from the club members, congratulations to Sourojeet, Enming, Alex, and Samir for being legally (no rules were broken) elected to be Prez, VP, AVP, and Trez respectively! 

Recently, we collaborated with MathSoc and DSC to host resume reviews! The event was hugely successful with people constantly waiting outside MC Comfy to get their resume reviewed. Thank you to everyone who helped out including the resume critics, reviewees, and organizers.

Our Beginning of Term event (BoT) is coming up soon on January Wednesday the 29th. It is going to be our largest BoT event yet with big aspirations, such as not getting pizza for once. Hold this with a grain of salt as our fate depends on the invincible budget cutting task force known as the MathSoc Council. Only time will tell whether our internal new ambitions will ever come to see the light of day. All words said, be sure to show up as we will have good food and fun activities regardless of what Council thinks!

If you want a talk on a specific topic, and know a professor, or grad student that would be willing to present a talk on it. Whether it be about trains, AI, or even the technology behind ICBMs, send an email to [exec@csclub.uwaterloo.ca](mailto:exec@csclub.uwaterloo.ca) with their name, and topic! We’ll reach out to them and ask whether they want to give a talk, we’ll sort out the logistics as long as they bring the topic!

The beloved Projects Program makes a return! Right now we’re planning out how to run the Projects Program this term, but stay tuned, we’ll be hopefully announcing it by Mid-March. For anyone who doesn’t know, the Projects Program is an event where you can join as either an individual, or a team. Then you, and your team will work on a cs-related project of your own choosing throughout the term. Every so often, we’ll run an event related to it, where we check in, and talk about our progress. Then at the end, we’ll judge the projects, and award prizes to the winners!For anyone who liked CSC Circles in the past, it’s returning! Date is still TBD, but stay tuned!!!!

Finally, we have plans to bring back the hugely successful ALT-TAB. The date is still TBD, but expect it to run around the time EoT (End of Term event) would typically run. If you don’t already know, ALT-TAB is for you (yes you, the reader or anyone in general) to give a talk about any passion they are involved with. It is for you to share your ideas with your peers in a talk-like format! Be sure to look out for this upcoming event.

## CSC Flash - Fun!

We’ve received funding to spend a little less than 40k on a server from SLEF (Student Life Endowment Fund, WUSA). 40k also happens to be enough to buy a car!!!! We’ll buy the server at some point… We’re currently considering buying a CSC (CS Corvette) to add to our arsenal of “why does CSC own this thing?”

Recently, on a cold morning, the NEAC (Non-Existent Activity Committee, EngSoc) came into existence and decided to vandalise the CSC door. They very rudely taped an ugly purple poster onto our beautiful club room door located at MC 3036 and left a cold-blooded letter detailing their disgusting activities. Even after a week, we are still in shock that such a tragedy occurred and we are looking for active ways to retaliate. Perhaps we shall get a M5 sooner than expected ;). 

We are restocking and updating the CSC library, the most comprehensive MathSoc library. We need recommendations for new textbooks or books on C++, Rust, and RISC-V. If you haven’t checked a book out from us yet, perhaps this article is your calling to visit the office and see our enormous and diverse set of books. Come and indulge in your love for books.
