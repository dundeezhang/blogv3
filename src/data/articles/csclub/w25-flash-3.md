# W25 CSC FLASH 3

March 10, 2025

**SIGBOVIK**: The only computer science conference where your paper on “Different Sorting Methods Tested by Stalin” might win Best Paper… and Worst Paper simultaneously. However, this conference won’t be accepting submissions for much longer! So if you wanted to submit a proof on why Stalin Sort is the best sort, your best bet is to submit right now.

**Christopher Batty**, an Associate Professor here at the University of Waterloo, is giving a talk about computer graphics on **March 11 at 5:30 PM in DC 1302**. He is an expert in computer graphics and computational physics, so it’s basically guaranteed to be a banger talk from an ultimate sigma. Please come—it will be fun. There will also be food for you freeloaders.

**CSC Trivia** is coming back! It’s planned to be held on **March 12 from 7:00–10:00 PM in QNC 1502**. Team up with friends and tackle trivia questions to possibly win some epic CSC prizes! Food will be there again for you freeloaders (you better appreciate it), and this will be the biggest event CSC hosts this term. We better see you there… If not… Stalin Sort. If you’re worried about not knowing enough computer science, it’s completely okay—you will not be decimated, as the trivia will cover topics beyond the bounds of CS.

**Hiring Notice**: Have you ever wanted to make a change in your school? Or do you just want to join a creed of alcoholics who run this club? Make sure to check out our club Instagram page: @uwcsclub to get the latest information on hiring. Be quick, as hiring may end sooner than you think! We’re hiring for a variety of roles, from events coordinators to external affairs coordinators. Please apply—we are not as depressed as you may think.

The Mathematics Faculty Relations Office is hosting a **Faculty Donor Appreciation Lunch** on March 12. Make sure to pop by and say thanks to the people who help keep the school from going fully under. Stop by **MC 5201 between 10:00 AM and 3:30 PM on March 12** to get some free food and appreciate the people who allow us to keep running.

**ML Reading Group** is still being held! If you want to learn more about Machine Learning, we are hosting weekly readings with DSC to uncover the deep secrets and complex algorithms behind the magic of AI and ML. We welcome all skill levels, including you first years :eyes:. So come on Wednesdays! BTW, there is also free food and drinks :grin:.

Finally, make sure to visit our **club office** at **MC 3036/3037** and say hi. We have near-perfect uptime during the day and somewhat tolerable uptime at night. The point is, if you come by, there’s a high likelihood that CSC will be open. If you’re worried that we’re closed, check out our club discord located on the footer of csclub.ca to see if our office is currently open.

> Our quote of the week in the office is:  “ALRIGHT WHO THE F\*\*\* SIGNED UP FOR A P\*\*\*H\*B ACCOUNT ON THE EXEC EMAIL.” – Iris Liao [CSC CRO]


> The geese return, a fearsome sight,
> 
> Honking loud from morning to night.
> 
> Campus quakes beneath their reign,
> 
> Sidewalks lost to their disdain.
> 
> Waddle forth, with heads held high,
> 
> Glaring as the students sigh.
> 
> March has come, and so have they,
> 
> Waterloo is theirs to stay.

CSC FLASH OUT.
